          "10/10 po on the overall experience. This is my first time having a
          proper training before deployment on the project and for me this is a
          fun and helpful experience. The training exercises as well as the
          trainers are very helpful on refreshing basic knowledges, providing
          new techniques and introducing new technologies. For me the highlight
          of the whole training is the presentation part. It gives me more
          confidence in presenting my work and help me improve my skills based
          on the trainers feedback."
